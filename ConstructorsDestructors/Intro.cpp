| 1      | Constructor helps to initialize the object of a class.                       | Whereas destructor is used to destroy the instances.           |
| 2      | It is declared as `className( arguments if any ){ Constructor’s Body }`.     | Whereas it is declared as `~className( no arguments ){ }`.     |
| 3      | Constructor can either accept arguments or not.                              | While it can’t have any arguments.                             |
| 4      | A constructor is called when an instance or object of a class is created.    | It is called while object of the class is freed or deleted.    |
| 5      | Constructor is used to allocate the memory to an instance or object.         | While it is used to deallocate the memory of an object of a class. |
| 6      | Constructor can be overloaded.                                               | While it can’t be overloaded.                                  |
| 7      | In a class, there can be multiple constructors.                              | While in a class, there is always a single destructor.         |
