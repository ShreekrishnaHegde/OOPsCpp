/*
------------------Difference between Pointer and Smart Pointer---------------------
->Pointer is not destroyed in any form when it goes out of its scope
->They are very labor-centric/manual.
->A pointer is a variable that maintains a memory address as well as data type information about that memory location. 
    A pointer is a variable that points to something in memory.

->It destroys itself when it goes out of its scope
->They are automatic/pre-programmed in nature.
->Itâ€™s a pointer-wrapping stack-allocated object. Smart pointers, in plain terms, are classes that wrap a pointer, or scoped pointers.
