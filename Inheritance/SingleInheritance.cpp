/*

In single inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit from only one class. i.e. one base class is inherited by one derived class only.

Syntax

class subclass_name : access_mode base_class
{
  //  body of subclass
};

*/


// C++ program to demonstrate how to implement the Single
// inheritance
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// base class
class Vehicle {
    public:
        Vehicle() { 
            cout << "This is a Vehicle\n";
        }
};

// sub class derived from a single base classes
class Car : public Vehicle {
    public:
        Car() { 
            cout << "This Vehicle is Car\n"; 
        }
};

// main function
int main(){
    // Creating object of sub class will
    // invoke the constructor of base classes
